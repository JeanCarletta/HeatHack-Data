# How to use the plots



These plots work best on a large screen.  

- You can also hide the menu on the left by clicking on the icon that looks like a ladder.

- If you can't see the right edge of the plot, try using your browser zoom features to get the full plot.  

- On many browsers, ctrl-+ (holding the control button and the + sign at the same time) will zoom in and ctrl-minus (the control button with the minus sign) will zoom out.  Zooming is also available from the browser menus.  

To explore the data you can:

- Use the slider to see the range of dates you want. Sliding on the edge of the current range will expand or contract it. Sliding in the middle will move the range forwards or backwards.

- Use the hour, day, week, ... buttons to go in or out quickly.

- If you have multiple thermal monitors, clicking on them in the legend will turn them on or off.  Double clicking will select just the one.     

Our monitors aren't perfect so give the occasional rogue reading.  If it's way out of line with what's been happening and doesn't recur, it's not real and you can ignore.  We're still working on how best to clean the rogue data from the plots.
