# HeatHack Test Book

This is a test of Github Pages rendering, before we commit to Jupyter Book.  It's mostly the default Jupyter Book with a few simple format tests added to the beginning.

This is public, but of no use to anyone but the developers yet (sorry).

See [the Jupyter Book documentation](https://jupyterbook.org) for documentation.
