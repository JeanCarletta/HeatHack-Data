# Admonitions formatting

```{note}
Notes have a nice format with a relevant icon and a specific colour.  
```

```{warning}
See, this one is a bit different because it's a warning.  We want a bunch of possibilities like this that aren't types they have natively:  Key Concept (which is a some science), Fun Fact!, and Further Readings. 
```

Admonitions are the general case where you can say gets in the "header", but how do you set the icon and colour - where does the "class" go and what are the ones that are already defined?

```{admonition} Key Concepts 
:class: tip
Here's some text about some science.
```

```{admonition} Further Readings
:class: tip
How do we make this one different?
```

```{admonition} Fun Fact!
:class: tip
And this one - can it be fun?
