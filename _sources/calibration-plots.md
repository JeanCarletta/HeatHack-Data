# Comparing sensors - our calibration plots

These are cheap sensors, and before we send out the thermal monitors we try to remember to test them against a set of monitors plus a few commercial loggers that use a different kind of sensor.  We do the testing in batches of around 10 thermal monitors, sometimes with Lascar EL-WIN-USB loggers alongside, and try to vary the temperature and relative humidity as best we can without dedicating lots of time to it. We don't send out any "duff" sensors, but RH readings always vary a bit, with a few sensors reading on the high or low side.  

You can see how your sensor performed here.
