# Downloading data to plot separately

If you prefer to plot your data in Excel, you can download your full data here:

- [Data CSV files](https://github.com/JeanCarletta/HeatHack-Data/tree/main/deviceData)

Choose your data file from the list and click on it.  You'll see something like the image shows - click on the image to make it larger.  If you click on "Raw", you can then right-click to see a menu that will let you save the data file as CSV.

```{image} ./download-data.png
:alt: choose the raw data format to save the data
:class: bg-primary mb-1
:width: 400px
:align: center
```

If you any issues, for instance, with the timestamp format, let us know - our Excel handles it natively, but yours may not.

We provide some example Excel and Google sheets that handle basic plotting.  In plotting temperature against a user diary, they assume an advanced feature, lambda functions, that is available in Google Sheets and the very latest version of Excel, but not earlier versions.
