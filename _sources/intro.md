# HeatHack Test Book

This is HeatHack's test of Jupyter Book as a way of producing reading materials for the programme and graphs of temperature and relative humidity data for each of our participating venues.  

The book builds automatically when changes are pushed to the main branch of the repository (when enabled, at least).

This is public, but of no use to anyone but the developers (sorry).

See [the Jupyter Book documentation](https://jupyterbook.org) for documentation.
