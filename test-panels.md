# Test of panels

We want to know what panels look like on GitHub Pages.  Here's one.

Radiation in the sun
^^^
:TODO: Put some simple graphic in here, like a PNG.  Eventually it will show the sun with some waves with arrows on pointing to a wall.  Do we have to be careful about the original file size - does it scale it to fit nicely?  What does it do on a mobile? 
+++
The sun is very hot, and heat transfers from it to the surfaces around it, no matter how far away they are.

What usually happens in churches
^^^
:TODO: Put some simple graphic in here, like a PNG. Eventuall it will show a person in a box shape with some stained glass window shapes shown on it, with waves pointing from the person to all of the box.
+++
The person is warmer than the surrounding surfaces, so heat transfers from the person to the building.

At some point we want to know, how hard is it to put a javascript simulation in (for now, any simple one will do)?
